# Decimal Clock
I recently came into an article [describing the origins why we measure time the way we do](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/experts-time-division-days-hours-minutes/). There are 12 months in a year, 28-31 days in a month, 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute. Years, months, and days are defined through astronomical phenomemons, while hours, minutes, and seconds are relatively arbitrary. This gave me an idea: Why not make it decimal?

I've always been frustrated by the imperial measurement system. I have, and probably always will be, a metric man. 100 centimeters in a meter and 1000 meters in a kilometer, it's clear. 1760 yards in a mile is unintuitive to say the least.

My idea is to make time work the same way. I'm not going to mess with year, month, and day because they are largely driven by astronomical events. I will, however, change the definition of hours, minutes, and seconds.

Here's what I propose:

- no AM/PM, it leads to confusions
- 100 decimal hour to a day (1 decimal hour == 14.4 minutes)
- 10 decimal minute to a decimal hour (1 decimal minute == 1.44 minutes)
- 100 decimal second to a decimal minute (1 decimal second == 0.864 seconds)

This clock is a clock that simulates what it would be like living in a decimal world
